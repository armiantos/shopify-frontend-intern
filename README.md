# Shopify Front End Summer 2020 Intern Challenge

![CI](https://github.com/armiantos/shopify-frontend-intern/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=main)

This project was created using React, Redux, Material-UI in Typescript. The use of Redux in this project is overkill,
but I would like to show that I can learn and use Redux's best practices despite not having other prior experience.

I chose Material-UI due to familiarity, I spent 3 months working on a confidential project at Microsoft using Angular
and Material Design.
